# magma-decompression
MATLAB code for using water concentration gradients in olivine or cpx to constrain syneruptive magma decompression rates. This example is set up to fit a water concentration gradient measured along the crystallographic 'a' axis of an olivine phenocryst from the 1977 eruption of Seguam volcano.
